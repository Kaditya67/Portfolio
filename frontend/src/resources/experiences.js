        description: 'As the lead developer, I am responsible for managing and maintaining the main official website of the college. This includes overseeing the overall functionality, ensuring smooth performance, and addressing any technical issues that arise. Together with my team, we successfully updated a significant portion of the website, enhancing both the design and functionality. One of our major accomplishments was the overhaul of key sections, such as the events calendar and course offerings, to make them more user-friendly and visually appealing. In addition, we focused on improving the user experience (UX) by implementing responsive design, optimizing load times, and ensuring that the website is accessible across all devices.

        description: 'In this project, I worked with my team on a cutting-edge project focused on "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning" (AIML). As the lead developer, I was responsible for both the frontend and backend development, ensuring a seamless integration between the two. We built the project from the ground up, implementing various machine learning models and AI algorithms that were tailored to solve real-world problems. The project was developed during a 36+ hour-long hackathon, which required a great deal of coordination, problem-solving, and time management. During the hackathon, I led the team in breaking down complex tasks, assigning roles, and overseeing the technical aspects of the project to ensure we met our goals. On the frontend, I focused on creating an intuitive and engaging user interface, while on the backend, I integrated the machine learning models and ensured smooth data flow. Despite the time constraints, our team managed to deliver a functional prototype that demonstrated the power of AI and ML in practical applications.'
